                        </a> discussed the career of Dr. Agatha Huepenbecker Burnet (1930 – 2012), a dedicated Iowa State University
                        (ISU) professor and administrator. Burnet championed the creation of a museum collection of textiles
                        and clothing at ISU. Through travel, she built a museum-quality personal collection of ethnographic
                        textiles and clothing, especially strong in its holdings from Central and South America. This collection,
                        bequeathed to the Textiles and Clothing Museum (TCM), formed the core of the exhibition, which was
                        curated in honor of this donation and the inaugural year of the Agatha Huepenbecker Burnet Endowed
                        Assistantship with the TCM.</p>

                    <p><a href="http://www.fitnyc.edu/museum/exhibitions/retrospective.php" target="blank"><em>RetroSpective</em></a> examined fashion’s fascination with its own history by presenting an overview of historical
                        references in fashion, paying particular attention to recurrence of silhouette. On display were groupings
                        of period fashions and their more recent reincarnations, spanning 250 years of fashion, beginning
                        with the 18th century. The cycle of revival in contemporary fashion has accelerated rapidly, but
                        this exhibition demonstrated that the reinterpretation of historical silhouettes or details is far
                        from a modern phenomenon.

                        Participation in sports, for recreation as well as competition, has increased dramatically since
                        the late nineteenth century. The clothing worn for such pursuits has often been influenced by fashion—and
                        vice versa.

                        act as an immediate signifier of gender – however, while making distinctions between “masculine”
                        and “feminine” styles of clothing may seem natural, gendering is not a biological phenomenon. While
                        much of the show discussed the changing ideas of “appropriate” attire for each gender, it also included
                        examples of so-called unisex and androgynous fashion.</p>
